# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

#### total ####

# Take an array as input
# Should output the sum of the elements in the array
# Define a method total that iterates through the elements of the array and returns the sum

#### sentence_maker ####

# Take an array of strings and numbers as input
# Should output a formal sentence string
# Define a method sentence_maker that takes the first element of the array and call capitalize on it, then append a '.' at the end of the array, and calling the join method (' ') on the array
