# U2.W4: SOLO CHALLENGE Calculate the Median!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Array is the input
# Output should return the median of the array
# Method median should take an array and check the first element to verify that it is a string, if true then sort the array alphabetically and return the middle-postion element of the array. Else if the first element of the array is not a string then return the middle-position element of the array.
